# VidGet

Download videos and music from YouTube to your Personal Computer in just a couple of Minutes! 

# How to use it? 

First download this folder and extract it to your PC: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CQD2hJ0kiRUspauc9cueAdlgJFnoet9e?usp=sharing 
After that find the Application file called: "YouTubeDownloader" and double click on it to open it up. 
Next, just follow the instructions gived to download any video from YouTube to your device in (Almost) any format, you want. 
In long story short, first input the URL to the video, that you want to downlaod and then you will get a huge list of all possible formats, so just input the number, next to the format you want to download and press Enter. After that, just wait for YouTubeDownloader Application (VidGet) to close, which means that the downlaoding has ended and then you can find the video or music that you want in the same folder, that you opened YouTube Downloader (VidGet), so just drag and drop it from there to anywhere you want.

DO NOT MOVE ANY FILES FROM DOWNLAOD FOLDER, BECAUSE THEN THE PROGRAM WONT WORK EXCEPT THE VIDEOS THAT YOU DOWNLOAD. 

That is all! I tried to make it as simple as Possible :) ;) . 

# How does it work? 

It is builded using python3, pip and pytube, which is one of pythons libs. 
I can promise you that there is no malware in this program and if you still do not trust me, you can find the code behind it in this repo, so that you can check it out, under the belt, how does it really work. 
As you can see, it really is very simple program and I have created it in 1 hour. 

# Credits

Well, I have created this, since I felt the need for some short, simple program like this to download the videos from youtube and then when I have created it, I just want to share it with others, who might benefit from it too. 
If you have any other idea of some simple, short and most importantly useful programs like this one, you can just contact me and send me that idea, then I will make new repo for it and add you in "Credits" section by telling that it was your idea, only my execution.
